## Short Summary
### Background 

Under the serve impact of pandemic, there is a growing concern regarding the changes of tourists' preferences after COVID-19, due to the difference in social values and priorities during pandemic era. Study in Guayaquil highlighted that participants do prefer to visit places that are less crowded and environmentally friendly, and only 7.3% of people do not have changes in travel attitude (Orden-Mejía et al., 2022). Reviewing the tourism in UK, in 2021 Tourism Recovery Plan, swift recovery to pre-pandemic levels is one of the objectives, while tourism industry is expected to contribute to the promotion and conservation of cultural and natural heritage (DCMS, 2021). This study aims to observe the changes in tourist preferences through studying the distribution of Airbnb listings in London before and after COVID-19 and provide a prediction for the future trend in tourism industry.

### Key Findings



### Recommendations

In order to quickly restore the London tourism market to pre-pandemic levels, the City of London must correct the direction of tourism promotion. It is necessary to develop and promote 1,157 open green spaces that London has that are not crowded. This will instill a sense of awareness among visitors to London that it is eco-friendly place and safe from contagious diseases that may come in the future.

## Research Design 
This study will analysis the tourists' preferences through comparative and regression analysis. The first two sections present the distribution of Airbnb booking listings before and after COVID-19 to observe the pattern and characteristics of listings in Greater London area. Geographically weighted regression analysis will then apply to Airbnb booking listings and several descriptive variables. The regression considers major post-COVID-19 preferences of tourists as independent variables:
(1) Tourist Attractions
Recent report pointed out that outdoor attractions in UK has the strongest recovery to pre- pandemic level in comparison with mixed sites and indoor sites, in which the most-visited attractions in 2021 are topped by park and gardens in London (Khomami, 2022). Under the influence of COVID-19, the spatial behaviour of tourists showed an increasing overall population in urban natural attractions, showing a stronger intention to visit urban green space (Gao, Y. et al., 2021).
(2) Green Space
As destination choice are greatly determined by perceived risk, destination-related preferences presented changes to favour nature-based destinations during times of crisis, which is also a phenomenon occurred after SARS (Li et al., 2020). An example is the reshaped tourists' destination preferences in Spain where tourists has more interest in visiting natural environments than urban destinations, due to they are perceived as lower-density environments for both domestic and international tourism (Donaire et al., 2021).

(3) Population
The current health crisis leads to diminished preference for visiting crowded places when considering travel activities and hospitality options (Park et al., 2021). There is greater demand in holiday destinations that are less overcrowded to avoid places with greater capacity in attracting tourists (Orden-Mejía et al., 2022). 

Lastly, with reference to our findings, suggestions on possible policies are proposed to promote tourism according to the current tourist preferences.

## Brief Review of the Evidence from London

Offering a great variety of attractions, tourism is the second most vital sector to the economy of London that attracts both international and domestic visitors in the past decades, where a fifth of total national stock of hotel bedrooms are located at the city and contributes to 12% to London's GDP (Maxim, 2019). On the other hand, an explosive growth of Airbnb listings was observed between 2015 to 2019. According to La et al. (2022), Airbnb rentals showed centre-periphery characteristics by concentrating in the outer range of innermost CBD and varies according to the distance to centre, demonstrating spatial agglomeration in distribution. 


## Post-COVID-19 Tourist Perferences in London

Globally, the accommodation sharing sector is severely suffered from COVID-19 with a significant decreased demand in bookings on Airbnb across regions and the effect is often location-specific, especially for Airbnb's biggest destinations in 2019 like London and Toronto (Ford, 2021; Gerwe, 2021). However, studies showed that people are ready to restart travelling and optimistic about returning to their travel habit despite having health-related concerns (Ivanova et al., 2021).The phenomenon of revenge travel is expected to occur post COVID-19, which describe the intensified desire and demand for leisure travel after the regulations and lockdowns during the pandemic (Wang & Xia, 2021). Other than the raising travel intentions, tourist also present changes in travel preferences to search for destinations that are less crowded and environmentally friendly (Orden-Mejía et al., 2022). 

## Prediction

## Conclusion
### Summary of our result 

### Policy Suggestion 

we consider that green spaces tourism should be an important part of a destination promotion,
especially in those places where gardens and parks with historic value can be found. Nicolae
Romanescu Park is the example that best illustrates this statement. Its importance for Craiova is
related to its social and leisure function, appreciated by the citizens who acknowledge its cultural
value. Yet, its image as a cultural tourism attraction is only vaguely mentioned in some guidebooks.
Integrated to the urban green space system, together with other historic gardens and parks, N.
Romanescu Park may become a decisive touristic site within cultural and thematic tourism circuits
that should be promoted in Craiova. In the future, the tourism offer for Craiova will have to take
into consideration the tourism function of green spaces if it intends to promote Craiova as a
sustainable tourism destination. (GREEN SPACES AND URBAN TOURISM DEVELOPMENTIN CRAIOVA
MUNICIPALITY IN ROMANIA)

When planning or establishing future London tourism plan policy, do not consider the outbreak of COVID-19 as a crisis in the tourism industry, but as an opportunity to develop resilient and sustainable tourism policies. The reason is that there is a high possibility that people around the world will be exposed to infectious diseases other than Covid-19 in the future. Also, from current UK government want to develop secondary destinations to spread the economic benefits whilst easing pressure on ‘honeypot’ attractions. We will propose tourism polices that take advantage of outskirts of London and open green spaces.

First, from a sustainability point of view, attractions using natural area outside London should be developed. It should be constructed in an unpopulated outlying area. For example, develop 1,157 open green spaces in London with simple structures such as modernized with stripped black and white posts in The Court of Honor in Plais-Roya in Paris or wall of love in the Jehan Rictus garden square in Montmartre to disperse tourists to the outskirts. In addition, it can promote low-cost and high-efficiency through social media. Most social media users prefer to go to pretty places to take pictures. Also, this will be a good option for balanced regional development and epidemic control.

Second, promote green open spaces in relation to large-scale events, such as the 2024 Paris Olympic. The City of London can collaboration with the city of Paris. Then both cities can promote safe and environmentally friendly travel through green and open space through two iconic parks (Tuileries Gardens and Hyde Park).

These policies will strengthen the resilience of the London city’s tourism economy and better prepare it for future hazards. It will also consider how to encourage the dispersal of tourists and distribute the economic benefits of tourism all religions in London, including outskirts boroughs.
