## Short Summary
### Background 
    
Under the serve impact of pandemic, there is a growing concern regarding the changes of tourists' preferences after COVID-19, due to the difference in social values and priorities during pandemic era. Study in Guayaquil highlighted that participants do prefer to visit places that are less crowded and environmentally friendly, and only 7.3% of people do not have changes in travel attitude (Orden-Mejía et al., 2022). Reviewing the tourism in UK, in 2021 Tourism Recovery Plan, swift recovery to pre-pandemic levels is one of the objectives, while tourism industry is expected to contribute to the promotion and conservation of cultural and natural heritage (DCMS, 2021). This study aims to observe the changes in tourist preferences through studying the distribution of Airbnb listings in London before and after COVID-19 and provide a prediction for the future trend in tourism industry.

## Brief Review of the Evidence from London

Offering a great variety of attractions, tourism is the second most vital sector to the economy of London that attracts both international and domestic visitors in the past decades, where a fifth of total national stock of hotel bedrooms are located at the city and contributes to 12% to London's GDP (Maxim, 2019). On the other hand, an explosive growth of Airbnb listings was observed between 2015 to 2019. According to La et al. (2022), Airbnb rentals showed centre-periphery characteristics by concentrating in the outer range of innermost CBD and varies according to the distance to centre, demonstrating spatial agglomeration in distribution. 


## Post-COVID-19 Tourist Perferences in London

Globally, the accommodation sharing sector is severely suffered from COVID-19 with a significant decreased demand in bookings on Airbnb across regions and the effect is often location-specific, especially for Airbnb's biggest destinations in 2019 like London and Toronto (Ford, 2021; Gerwe, 2021). However, studies showed that people are ready to restart travelling and optimistic about returning to their travel habit despite having health-related concerns (Ivanova et al., 2021).The phenomenon of revenge travel is expected to occur post COVID-19, which describe the intensified desire and demand for leisure travel after the regulations and lockdowns during the pandemic (Wang & Xia, 2021). Other than the raising travel intentions, tourist also present changes in travel preferences to search for destinations that are less crowded and environmentally friendly (Orden-Mejía et al., 2022).

### Policy Suggestion 
When planning or establishing future London tourism plan policy, do not consider the outbreak of COVID-19 as a crisis in the tourism industry, but as an opportunity to develop resilient and sustainable tourism policies. The reason is that there is a high possibility that people around the world will be exposed to infectious diseases other than Covid-19 in the future. Also, from current UK government want to develop secondary destinations to spread the economic benefits whilst easing pressure on ‘honeypot’ attractions. We will propose tourism polices that take advantage of outskirts of London and open green spaces.  >> reference from uk https://www.visitbritain.org/sites/default/files/vb-corporate/sustainability_external_-_14th_oct.pdf
First, from a sustainability point of view, attraction tourism using natural area outside London should be developed. This will be a good option for balanced regional development and epidemic control. It should be constructed in an unpopulated outlying area. For example, to create a British royal horseback riding experience center in a natural area in London outskirts.  >>reference from OECD https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/rebuilding-tourism-for-the-future-covid-19-policy-responses-and-recovery-bced9859/
Second, promote green open spaces in relation to large-scale events, such as the 2024 Paris Olympic. The City of London can collaboration with the city of Paris. Then both cities can promote safe and environmentally friendly travel through green and open space through two iconic parks (Tuileries Gardens and Hyde Park). >> reference from US

These policies will strengthen the resilience of the London city’s tourism economy and better prepare it for future hazards. It will also consider how to encourage the dispersal of tourists and distribute the economic benefits of tourism all religions in London, including outskirts boroughs.
